      <h1>TKing's Top 10 Favorite Video Games</h1>
         <p>
           Video Games have been a passion of mine since I was a young child. My uncle introduced me to the SEGA Genesis when I was 4 years old and I was hooked ever since. Over the last 3 decades I have played hundreds of different video games as well as hundres of hours into a single game. I just love geting lost in the worlds, stories, and experiences that Video Games offer wether that be good or bad. That's why when I'm asked "What's your favorite video game." I find it one of the most difficult questions as the answer is ever changing and evolving but me and my friends decided to tackle this very question on our 100th episode of our podcast Game Budz. Below are my Top 10 Video Games of All Time (as of 2024) from this episode with a brief explaination of why I picked that game.

                     DK! Donkey Kong! I first got this game for Christmas in 2000 bundled with the Jungle Green Nintendo 64. I had yearned for a 64 for years and I finally had one of my own! I played it and DK 64 the whole Christmas Break and loved every minute of it. The game is classic Rare Collectathon game where you collect bananas, coins, fruit, and golden letter and each of the 6 characters had a set of collectables of their own, so there wsa plenty of stuff to find throughout the levels. The gameplay was challenging but not too difficult that prevented you from progressing through the game (though I certain Fire Dragonfly gave me a lot of trouble for a few days) and the atmosphere and music really drew you into the wacky world of Kong Island. If you are looking for a rewarding platformer on the N64 look no further than this classic.

                         Metroid Prime was the first game in the Metroid series that I actually played more than a few sessions. I anticipated it's release after I got the Gamecube and managed to get the first copy of it when it came out at our local game rental store. This entry shifts from the usual 2-D side-scrolling gameplay to a complete 3-D world set in first-person. The shift fit perfectly and allowed you to fully immerse into the world of Tallon IV, the homeworld of the Chozo. The combat and exploration are very balanced and keep you wanting to explore every inch of the world. I often come back to this game and am still amazed at how great it plays.

                        In 2004 it was hard to come by a more anticipated game than Halo 2 the sequel to the genre redefining game Halo: Combat Evolved. It was hyped up with an amazing trailer the previous year at E3 2003 and acommpanied by the reveal of the released date by Peter Moore the VP of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division at that time, who anncounced it by showing a tattos of the date and logo of the game on his arm. I awaited the game and got it on the midnight release and played it as soon as I got home. It took the fast past first-person action of the first and took it to the next level. The story was epic and felt like a blockbuster movie which was rather new at the time. The multiplayer was legendary and my friends and I played matches for hours and throughout the years until Reach came out much later. While the newer entries have greatly improved upon the series this game still gives that epic feeling and thrilling gameplay.
