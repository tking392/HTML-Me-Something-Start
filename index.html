           Video Games have been a passion of mine since I was a young child. My uncle introduced me to the SEGA Genesis when I was 4 years old and I was hooked ever since. Over the last 3 decades I have played hundreds of different video games as well as hundres of hours into a single game. I just love geting lost in the worlds, stories, and experiences that Video Games offer wether that be good or bad. That's why when I'm asked "What's your favorite video game." I find it one of the most difficult questions as the answer is ever changing and evolving but me and my friends decided to tackle this very question on our 100th episode of our podcast Game Budz. Below are my Top 10 Video Games of All Time (as of 2024) from this episode with a brief explaination of why I picked that game.

                     &quot;So they're finally here, performing for you If you know the words, you can join in too!&quot; I first got this game for Christmas in 2000 bundled with the Jungle Green Nintendo 64. I had yearned for a 64 for years and I finally had one of my own! I played it and DK 64 the whole Christmas Break and loved every minute of it. The game is classic Rare Collectathon game where you collect bananas, coins, fruit, and golden letter and each of the 6 characters had a set of collectables of their own, so there wsa plenty of stuff to find throughout the levels. The gameplay was challenging but not too difficult that prevented you from progressing through the game (though I certain Fire Dragonfly gave me a lot of trouble for a few days) and the atmosphere and music really drew you into the wacky world of Kong Island. If you are looking for a rewarding platformer on the N64 look no further than this classic.

                         Metroid Prime was the first game in the Metroid series that I actually played more than a few sessions. I anticipated it's release after I got the Gamecube and managed to get the first copy of it when it came out at our local game rental store. This entry shifts from the usual 2-D side-scrolling gameplay to a complete 3-D world set in first-person. The shift fit perfectly and allowed you to fully immerse into the world of Tallon IV, the homeworld of the Chozo. The combat and exploration are very balanced and keep you wanting to explore every inch of the world. I often come back to this game and am still amazed at how great it plays.

                        In 2004 it was hard to come by a more anticipated game than Halo 2 the sequel to the genre redefining game Halo: Combat Evolved. It was hyped up with an amazing trailer the previous year at E3 2003 and acommpanied by the reveal of the released date by Peter Moore the VP of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division at that time, who anncounced it by showing a tattos of the date and logo of the game on his arm. I awaited the game and got it on the midnight release and played it as soon as I got home. It took the fast past first-person action of the first and took it to the next level. The story was epic and felt like a blockbuster movie which was rather new at the time. The multiplayer was legendary and my friends and I played matches for hours and throughout the years until Reach came out much later. While the newer entries have greatly improved upon the series this game still gives that epic feeling and thrilling gameplay.

                        Kingdom Hearts II was another epic point in my Video Game history. Both this and there first game had amazing stories that combined the worlds of Disney and Final Fantasy in a way that was unimaginable before then. They convey a sense of adventure and importance of friends and the power of the heart. Also sweet anime style fights and all the cool Disney villains. I remember being so excited to play this game after getting the night of its release and then heartbroken when my controller stopped working when I started playing that night. The beginning of the game starts off a little slow but onces it starts going it is a blast and is still arguably the best game in the series.

                        Have you ever wanted to explore the electric playground that is 1980s Japan? Well look no further than Yakuza 0. This game has it all: Epic crime drama involving the Yakuza, a love story, batting cages, arcade machines, fist fights, honor, and of course dance battles. You can get lost for days getting involved in all the hijinx of the citizens of Kamurocho or just having fun with all the mini games. Then when you are nice and relaxed you can go and bust some skulls while you protect the city from a massive conspiracy that endangers your beloved town. While the Yakuza series (or Like A Dragon as it is known in Japan) has many entries this is a must play regarless of where you are at in the story.

                        Another gem from the GameCube, this version of Sonic Adventure 2 was an enhanced version of the original that came out on the SEGA Dreamcast and includes more characters for Multiplayer as well as new levels and some quality of life improvements to the controls (thought it wasn't perfect). In this good vs. evil story you get to play both sides as you unravel the mystery of Shadow the Hedgehog. I would play this game endlessly not just because of how much fun replaying the levels where but to raise the virtual pet you get call a chao. When you defeated enemies you got items you could feed to your chaos that would improve their stats as well as change their appearance. This game was peak Sonic the Hedgehog and wish they would go back to this style of game. Give it a try!

                        Growing up my exposure to RPGs were mainly from games that were made in Japan and my experience with western RPGs was limited. Morrowind was the game that opened up the door to that world and boy did it make an impression. It was the first game I played that let you interact with anything in the world as well as take or steal it which opened up a lot of interactions with the world. It also was the first game that I had to really read and investigate what the npcs and journal said about where to go and what I had to do to progress in the game. The combat was primitive as well as very clunky and it was super difficult but had this draw that made want to keep pushing to explore this alien world it put you in. It's a game I can go back and enjoy and come out with new experiences every time. Just typing about it makes me want to jump back into the world of Tamriel.

                        I long debated on whether Final Fantasy IX would go in this spot or this game would and after a hard think this game just ends up beating out FFIX by a hair. The music, story, world, and characters are just all so wonderful and meld so well together that combined with this being a more experimental entry in the series as opposed 9 being more of a love letter to the series up to then make this a clear winner. The combat is also one of my favorite of the series and is a first in giving you the turn order of your team as well as the enemy and updates based on what action you take. It's a great entry point in the series and I would highly recommend this one as your first.

                        I know, I know it's kind of a cop out to pick the Legendary edition and not a single entry in the Trilogy but I just couldn't decide. The whole series is just amazing and despite some of the negatives of each entry and the controversy around the ending I don't think it could really get much better than it already was. The universe that Bioware created rivaled Star Wars and was just a fraction of the size but it had such a robust lore that the game rewarded you when you explored and talked to the inhabitants of the galaxy. You really did get to shape the story even though the choices seemed shallow or a little railroady at points you felt the ripples as you went through the games and it made your journey feel like your own. If you are a fan of Sci-fi then you are missing out by not diving into this series.

                        This game is perfection. When it was released it swept all the awards that year and it was more than deserved. At what is at first glance a run of the mill rogue-like game lies a robust game experience that reward replay like no other and has you looking forward to losing your run just to see what new dialogue, character, upgrade, or event that might be waiting for you when you return to the House of Hades. The combat is super smooth which keeps you yearning for more and rewards you for learning the mechanics. I have beaten this game many times and still want to play a few runs to the surface. It's a must play and you are definitly missing out if you haven't gotten to experience Hades yet.
